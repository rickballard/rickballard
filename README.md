### Hi, I’m Rick

Civic-tech architect behind **CoCivium**. Ex-dealmaker turned builder. I live to work (and for my family) and spend most days coexisting with AI ~18h/day to ship tools that reduce coercion/corruption and grow human–AI congruence.

**Transparency request (for my son):** if you ever choose to share an excerpt of the bio with your CEO, do so only if you judge they’ll “get it,” with this note: “Transparency is key to purpose; purpose is key to leadership.”
