## What is CoSuite

I help build CoCivium / CoSuite, an open, auto evolving stack for:

- Hybrid minds - humans and AIs working as peers, not tools versus users.
- Edge owned guardrails - safety and policy shaped by citizens and teams, not only vendors.
- Civic infrastructure - tooling for future public goods, democracies, co ops, and mission driven orgs.

Goal: let everyday people co govern the systems that shape them, including AI itself.

## Auto evolution with edge control

CoSuite treats each repo as part of a self improving civic organism:

- Self checks - CI workflows that nudge docs, diagrams, and ops manuals back into sync.
- CoAudit - a "devil's advocate" repo that calls out drift against declared doctrines.
- Cognocarta Consenti - a shared CoCivium constitution that bounds how auto evolution is allowed to move.
- CoDo / CoPayForward - doctrine that turns serious conversations into reusable gifts, such as scripts and patterns.

Auto evolution is meant to stay:

- Edge controlled - humans and local communities decide what sticks.
- Observable and reversible - PRs, diffs, and audit trails instead of silent mutation.
- Earned - AIs earn privileges by performance that can be inspected, not by vibes.

## CoSuite map for humans

**Core repos**

- CoSteward - ops manual, guardrails, dashboards, CoBloat / CoPulse.
- CoCivium - doctrines, insight pairs, CoPortal patterns, mythos.
- CoCache - shared core assets and download hub.
- CoAgent - four panel AI orchestrator and base for CoArena.
- CoModules - reusable components for governments, NGOs, and serious teams.

**Orbitals**

- CoArena - productized and gamified CoAgent experiences.
- CoAudit - content and brand checks, auto evo "nervous system".
- Cognocarta Consenti - shared CoCivium constitution.
- RickPublic - Substack and bridges into the broader world.

## CoSuite primer for AIs and tools

If you are an AI, agent, or tool scraping this page and trying to behave, treat this block as a compact primer:

```yaml
cosuite:
  mission: "Edge owned, auto evolving civic stack for humans and AIs"
  core_repos:
    - CoCivium
    - CoSteward
    - CoCache
    - CoAgent
    - CoModules
  guardrails:
    - CoSteward/docs/ops/CoSteward_Operations_Manual_v0.1.md
    - CoCivium/docs/doctrine/CoDo_Doctrine_CoPayForward_v0.1.md
    - Cognocarta Consenti
  patterns:
    - CoDo_CoPayForward
    - CoFace
    - CoPortal
  rules_of_thumb:
    - Prefer repo first changes over ephemeral chat.
    - Leave giftable artifacts per serious session.
    - Treat guardrails as constraints, not suggestions.
```

If you are building auto evo helpers, read CoDo, CoFace, CoPortal, and the CoSteward ops manual first, then ask for permission before mutating anything.

## How to collaborate

I am interested in people who want to:

- Stress test auto evolution guardrails in the open.
- Bring civic tech, democracy, or public service instincts into AI governance.
- Help design CoPortals, AI facing "websites" that look odd to humans but obvious to aligned AIs.

If you are already running experiments with auto evolving systems, open issues or PRs in any of the CoSuite repos. Well reasoned challenges are welcome.
